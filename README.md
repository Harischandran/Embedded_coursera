# Embedded_coursera

I am Harish.A.R whos pursuing education in the ECE department in my University.
I am very new to all the git related stuff and embedded systems in general.
This is a repository which completely has all the assignments regarding my course on embedded systems from coursera.
Only the m1 assessment has been completed as of now.
